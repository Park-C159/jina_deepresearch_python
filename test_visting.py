How it works.\n\nA function call output or tool call output refers to the response a tool generates using the input from a model\'s tool call. The tool call\n\nHow do I turn off parallel function calling in OpenAI? Parallel function calling You can prevent this by setting parallel_tool_calls to false , which ensures exactly zero or one tool is called. Note: Currently, if you are using a fine tuned model and the model calls multiple functions in one turn then strict mode will be disabled for those calls.\nAug 7, 2025; Get the latest on new Tesla models including spy shots, first drives, in-depth reviews, concept car photos, new features and more.\n\nModels · Latest news · Tesla Might Stop Including Physical Keys With Some New Cars · Tesla Added More Superchargers In Q3 Than The Next Nine Networks Combined.\n\nTesla Says Autopilot Is Getting Better.
